# XV6-OS-Lab
Worked on a series of low-level projects using the xv6 UNIX-like teaching OS, modifying the kernel to enhance process management, scheduling, and inter-process communication.

Lab 1 – System Calls & User Programs:
Implemented custom system calls for process introspection and memory tracking. Developed user-level programs to test syscall functionality and analyzed system behavior under various process loads.

Lab 2 – Lottery & Stride Scheduling:
Replaced xv6’s default round-robin scheduler with Lottery and Stride scheduling algorithms to ensure CPU time fairness. Added new syscalls to configure scheduling parameters and conducted experiments comparing performance, throughput, and fairness.

Lab 3 – Threading Library Implementation:
Built a lightweight user-level threading library using clone() and join() system calls. Designed and tested multithreaded programs, demonstrating manual context switching and synchronization within the xv6 environment.

Gained hands-on experience with kernel development, scheduling algorithms, syscall design, and thread management at the OS level.
